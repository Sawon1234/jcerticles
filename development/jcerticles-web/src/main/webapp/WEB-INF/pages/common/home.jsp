				<h1>Welcome to JCerticles</h1>
				
				<p><strong>JCerticles</strong> stands for Java Certification and Articles, is a place where you can find ample resources on Java and Java
				based technologies and frameworks. You will also find mock exams targeted towards several
				Oracle Java certification tracks. I will try to keep up quality on the type of questions that
				you will find in the mock exams. Should you find any discrepancies in the questions and their answers, I
				would be glad to hear from you. You can write to me @ codeintheopen@gmail.com
				</p>

				<h1>What else do I have at JCerticles</h1>

				<p>
                Apart from the mock exams, JCerticles also has some articles written by experts on some specific technologies.
                The articles will offer you an end to end idea or know how on a certain problem domain. For example., if you want to know
                how to set up SSL in Tomcat, the article would describe practically what you need to do to set up SSL in Tomcat.
                I can read what you might be thinking at this moment. What is so special with the articles that are offered here
                when the web already offers tons and tons of articles, blogs? I cannot answer this now, but I will try to bring
                in some differentiation in my articles and in the end eventually add value to your time you spent on reading it.
                Let us see.

				<p>
                Articles apart. I would also offer some quality code samples for a problem domain through JCerticles. I hope
                that you as a reader will not be disappointed with what you are looking for and with what you are reading here.

                A bit about this site. This is not just a web site rather it is a web app.
                I put to use Spring, AspectJ, mongoDB, Struts, jQuery, Lucene, TIKA to get this web app up and running. There is a lightweight CMS
                that I had built additionally with which I create my questions, articles, code samples and upload them here dynamagically.
                </p>
