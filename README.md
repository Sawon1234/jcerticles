Online Exam Engine, Articles and Photography
--------------------------------------------

This is a web application that contains many exams that can be taken online. The focus will primarily be on
Java / Scala and several technologies around them. I will later add exams and content related to physics and 
energy. 

Apart from the exams, this web app also hosts a plethora of articles centered around several technological topics.

This is still under development. I have made my first version 0.1 release to OpenShift PaaS. It is still under
construction though. 

I will update the Readme as and when I do something to this app!
